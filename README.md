# Protein-Binding-GNN
From Cyclica's AF2 Dataset

#### How to replicate the test results:
1. Download LSTM embeddings from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hXDXvksjqoI3hS2i_pyOp_Lw6hTMzS-E/view?usp=sharing and place it in ./data/
2. Download test csv w/o labels and place it in ./data/
2. Run generate_test_results_ipynb
3. Submissions will be generated in ./submission.csv

#### How to replicate training:
1. Download train file from cyclica and place in ./data2/raw/, and download AlphaFold2 Human proteins dataset directly from the website and place in ./data/
2. Run train_model.ipynb 
3. Takes about 5 minutes on a 3090ti
